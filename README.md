- Authors: Amos Okutse, Ian Liu, Man-Fang Liang

## Introduction

This repository contains code and data for the paper "Doubly-Robust Machine Learning Causal Estimation of Pathway Activity Effects in Breast Cancer Stage Progression and Survival". The study focuses on estimating the causal effects of pathway activities on breast cancer progression and survival using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the analysis. These data are from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and refer to breast cancer. Within this folder, we have data files for gene expression (`data_mrna_illumina_microarray.txt`), clinical information (`data_clinical_patient.txt`), patient sample information (`data_clinical_sample.txt`), gene mutation (`data_mutations_extended.txt`), and gene mutation data (`data_methylation_promoters_rrbs.txt`).
- `scripts/`: Contains the R and Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `results/`: Contains the output results, including figures and tables.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- `README.md`: This file. 

## Reproduction Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone 
  ```
